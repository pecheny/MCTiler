=======


Currently the OpenFL project offers to buy premium SWF library. Old version of this library (1.0.2) 
was released under MIT and it still can be used for free. Since enabling old version seems a little bit complicated 
this demo had been made as an example.
SWF 1.0.2 have some restrictions: 
* seems that usage of bitmaps in MovieClips was have not been implemended 
* only flash and c++ (android and windows was tested) targets tests run well. 
Neko target works buggy and a lot of work need to be done for build HTML5 version.  

Howewer the example uses complex animation (tweens, nested MovieClips) and "drawTiles" renderer.
Few features (stroke and shadow rendering) was implemented just for fun.
